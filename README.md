## Buy & Sell App - Lighthouse Labs Midterm Project

Auto World is a buy-and-sell app built with Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL where buyer/ seller can sign-up and communicate through the web. The seller can create posts and delete the posts he created. The buyer can favorite the cars they are interested in, look at them in Favourites page later. The buyer can communicate with  seller by sending a email and message.



## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm i`
2. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
3. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`  
4. Run the server: `npm run local`  
5. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples. 
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
